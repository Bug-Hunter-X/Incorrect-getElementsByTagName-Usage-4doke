This repository demonstrates a common error when working with the getElementsByTagName method in JavaScript within an HTML context. The bug showcases an attempt to directly modify the innerHTML property of a NodeList returned by getElementsByTagName, which results in an error. The solution illustrates the correct way to handle this scenario by iterating through the NodeList and modifying each element individually.
